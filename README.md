## _Problem Statement_
An emergency assist system aims to **_solve the urgent problem of delayed emergency response by leveraging technology._**

## _Introduction_

- The problem is **_Ambulances getting stuck in traffic, delaying critical medical help and risking lives._**
- This assisting system uses advanced tech to speed up ambulances/local emergency vehicleâ€™s through traffic thereby saving lives.
- The idea is to **_provide a network between the Common people,Ambulance Drivers,Traffic Systems and Hospital in case of any medical emergencies._** 
- This app allows the **_users(common people) to report the accident or any home emergency which requires an emergency support (First aid/Ambulance service)_**.The users can rate the severity of the patient or even describe the condition of the patient through text or picture.
- Later this report is sent to the nearest available ambulance driver as an **_alert requesting the service_**, along with the alert the **_current location and severity_** of the patient is sent to the driver interface.Driver is guided to the patients location through **_GPS service_**.
- After reaching the location and verifying the situation the patient is picked and our app starts the navigation to the **_nearest hospital(for first aid/treatment)._**
- Hospitals are sent an **_alert about the arriving patient_** so that they can be prepared to receive the patient with necessary first aid and treatment.
- This app allows the users and drivers to assess the emergency and provide accurate information about the hospitals nearby, which includes details like the **_distance to the hospital, traffic conditions and whether the required facility for the treatment is available or not._**
- En-route to the nearest hospital if an traffic signal or an congested traffic is encountered an **_early alert_** is sent to the traffic control room so that traffic can be managed/regulated to make way for the approaching ambulance.

## **_Relevance of work_**

- Real-time tracking of ambulance, provides timely alerts, facilitating quick ambulance passage through congested traffic.
- Easy navigation using GPS service.
- Alerting the Hospital about the arrival, severity and first aid required to provide immediate healthcare service.

## **_Advantages of proposed system_**

- Immediate response to accidents/emergency situations.
- Personalized hospital recommendations based on severity
- Real-time availability updates for hospitals
- Emergency navigation to recommended hospitals (ie: traffic regulation)
